# Useful Programs

This is a list of programs curated by Dalton Harrold. I do not intend to infringe upon the rights of any of the authors of these programs and do not claim any ownership of them. This list is provided without warranty or guarantee. I cannot be held liable for any losses or damages incurred. 

## Why I Made this

I made this list because I spent lots of time trying to find freeware that was made by developers who know what they're doing. I also encountered another problem: once I found them, I would eventually lose them. Therefore, I now help maintain a list of programs I've found in the past. 

## How to use this

First, you should keep scrolling down to find links to updated versions of the software. I will not be maintaining versions of all the software consistently, so if there's an update, you'll need to get it directly from its developer. I only kept copies of the software from when I downloaded them in case they were later taken off their original website. If you find a newer edition, create a pull request and I'll be happy to merge it with main.
