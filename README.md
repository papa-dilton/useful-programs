# Useful Programs

This is a list of programs curated by Dalton Harrold. I do not intend to infringe upon the rights of any of the authors of these programs and do not claim any ownership of them. 

## Why I Made this

I made this list because I spent lots of time trying to find freeware that was made by developers who know what they're doing. I also encountered another problem: once I found them, I would eventually lose them. Therefore, I now help maintain a list of programs I've found in the past. 

## How to use this

First, you should keep scrolling down to find links to updated versions of teh software. I will not be maintaining versions of all the software consistently, so if there's an update, you'll need to get it directly from it's developer. I only kept copies of the software from when I downloaded them in case they were later taken off their origional website. If you find a newer edition, create a pull request and I'll be hapy to merge with main.
